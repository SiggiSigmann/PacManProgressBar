Add a playful twist to your IntelliJ progress bar with PacManProgressBar. Watch Pac-Man navigate the bar, chased by ghosts, for a unique coding experience.

## Description
Introducing PacManProgressBar, a dynamic replacement for your IntelliJ progress bar. Inject a playful twist into your development journey with Pac-Man and 
ghosts tracking your project's progress. Choose between deterministic mode, with Pac-Man advancing steadily towards completion, or indeterministic mode, where 
Pac-Man navigates a maze of ghosts symbolizing ongoing tasks. With customizable settings and a nod to classic arcade gameplay, enhance your coding experience 
today.

## Usage
Once installed, enable PacManProgressBar in your IntelliJ settings and enjoy the animated progress bar as you code!

### Deterministic Mode
